# microscheme

![](https://github.com/benmkw/microscheme/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This is modeled after [(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))](https://norvig.com/lispy.html) and does not yet include [(An ((Even Better) Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))
](https://norvig.com/lispy2.html).

It is part of my attempt at learning more about rust and languages, see [lang](https://github.com/benmkw/lang)

It should be faster than the python interpreter but fib is about 5x slower than python so its still very slow.
